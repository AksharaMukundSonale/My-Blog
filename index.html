        <p class="text-muted text-left">I had visited Kabini with my family and friends back in 2021 and I stayed there for 2 days. It was a very beautiful place and we had buffet systems so we definitely had a lot of food as the food tasted amazing. We also saw different species of birds and I also saw alot many animals. There was also a beautiful pool but unfortunately due to covid we werent allowed to step inside the pool. However, there were other adventurous activities which were alot of fun. The resort that we stayed at also had a beautful room - plus point - it had a bath tub!</p>

        I had visited Taj Mahal with my family back in 2018. It was definitely a beautiful place (That is why it is one of The Seven Wonders Of the World).There were also different types of shops selling beautiful things and tasty food. That is one of my favorite places and I have visited Taj Mahal 6 times!

        <p class="text-muted text-left">
        I had visited Hogenakkal Falls with my family and friends. It was an amazing place! Hearing that sound of water falling down really helped me relax. And also there were tasty fishes which the people were selling. They made us sit in the circular boat and took us till the view point. They always allow boating near the fall but unfortunately the water flow was to fast and dangerous so we could not go there. But also while walking throught the jungle we saw many monkeys. They were junst hopping from one tree to another. One of the monkeys saw that we were having chips and as soon it knew that they were chips the monkey came and snatched the chips from one of my friend. And it scratched her too. After that we just washed our legs and went for collecting shells. It was my best trip ever!
